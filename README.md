This is how the Crowd FLOW NFT Randomizer works in the core aspect.
In order to make our procedure more transparent, we have open sourced this file.

The algorithm takes the following into account:
1. The current donation by the User
2. The donation history and credits stored of the User
3. The project specifications
4. The desire of the User to spend credit points
5. A randomization factor to surprise HODLers

NOTE: The algorithm is constantly evolving and might change in the future, subject to prior announcement.
